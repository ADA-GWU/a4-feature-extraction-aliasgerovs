### Usage

#### Task 1: Basic Feature Extraction
This task involves edge detection, corner detection, and the detection of lines and circles using Hough Transforms.

- **Edge Detection**
  ```bash
  python3 edge_analysis.py
  ```

#### Task 2: Active Contour
This task uses the Active Contour (snakes) algorithm to detect object borders.

- **Active Contour Detection**
  ```bash
  python3 active_contour.py
  ```

#### Task 3: Interest Points Detection
Implements ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect and match features between two images of the same scene from different angles.

- **Interest Points Detection**
  ```bash
  python3 interest_points.py
  ```
